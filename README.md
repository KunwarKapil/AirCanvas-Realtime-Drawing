Air Canvas: Gesture-Based Drawing Tool with OCR and TTS
Description
Air Canvas is an innovative tool that allows users to draw in real-time using hand gestures, powered by Mediapipe for hand tracking, OpenCV for video processing, and PyTesseract for text recognition (OCR). Additionally, the recognized text can be converted to speech using Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS).

Features
Hand Gesture Recognition: Draw on a virtual canvas by tracking hand and finger movements using Mediapipe.
Dynamic Color Selection: Choose from multiple colors for drawing.
Text Recognition (OCR): Extract text from the drawing using Tesseract OCR.
Text-to-Speech (TTS): Convert the recognized text into speech for auditory feedback.
Interactive UI: Intuitive interface with a "CLEAR" button and color palette for ease of use.
Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
OpenCV: Video processing and drawing functionalities.
Mediapipe: Hand tracking and gesture recognition.
PyTesseract: Optical Character Recognition for text extraction.
gTTS: Text-to-Speech conversion.
NumPy: Image data manipulation.
Collections (deque): Efficient point tracking for smooth drawing.
